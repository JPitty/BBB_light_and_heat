this builds the dtbo file
dtc -O dtb -o w1-00A0.dtbo -b 0 -@ w1.dts
then copied to /lib/firmware

the device tree overlay has to be loaded with:
echo w1 > /sys/devices/bone_capemgr.9/slots
or
sudo sh -c â€œecho w1 > /sys/devices/bone_capemgr.9/slots
which can be added to rc.local to start after boot

sensors are located at
/sys/devices/w1_bus_master1/28...

cat w1_slave to get reading

data line should be pulled up w/ 4k7 resistor
gang like lines together for multiple sensors
